This Python code was built to download historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using yfinance package designed specifically for this. We used specific bands and technical indicators and automated using Pythong to get sell and buy insights for the stock of interest. This can be automated to send emails with suggestions on specific symbol and even execute the trade if setup.
